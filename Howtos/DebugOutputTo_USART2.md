# Debug Output in Terminal via USART

## 1 Output

To display (debug) output to a terminal, on your host, there are 3 functions defined in the file: `\startup-code\syscalls.c`

1. `USART_Init(...)`
1. `_write_impl_USART_SendChar(...)`
1. `_write(...)`

When `USART2_Init(...)` is called during the initialization phase of your program, you can use standard output functions such as:

```C
printf("Debug this variable: %s\r\n",var1);     // Note the \r\n instead of just \n
puts("Enter function: HelloWorld()\r\n ");

````

The output will appear in a terminal emulator like **PuTTY**, provided the hardware and serial connection are correctly configured.

üìç More documentation can be found in the above meantioned `syscalls.c` file.

## 2 Input
Just like output above the `syscalls.c` also implements the system function: `int _read(...)` which makes sure you can ask for input in your **PuTTy** terminal with scanf function or by calling the function direct.

```
char name[50];   
unsigned  len = 50;    
_read(0, name, len);        // CR Return will end the input
```

## 3 Configure PuTTY

Assuming the files are already part of your project, and you're using the STM32F4-Discovery board (or a compatible one):

1. **Hardware Requirements**:
    - Make sure you have a ***USB-to-TTL Serial Cable*** (USB connector on one side and four lose connectors on the otherside, ***see remark*** below)

1. **Wiring**: Connect the USB-to-TTL cable between your host and the STM32 board:

    - USB-to-TTL TX ‚Üí STM32 PA3 (USART2 RX) (White)
    - USB-to-TTL RX ‚Üí STM32 PA2 (USART2 TX) (Green)
    - GND ‚Üí GND (black)
    - Power ‚Üí NOT needed (red)

1. **Make the connection**

    -  On the Host (Windows)
        - Locate the used COM port number using **Windows Device manager**
        - In the Host start **Putty** and configure it:
        - set the connection type to: **serial**
        - enter the **COM Port number**
        - specify the speed: **9600**

Once everything is connected and the program runs, output from the device will appear in the terminal.
