PURPOSE
    - Startup header file for the STM32F4-Discovery board. It declares:
        - Vector interrupt definitions (see details in the corresponding C file)
        - The Reset_Handler() function, which is referenced in the vector table and executed on device reset
        - The _init_data() function, called by Reset_Handler(), to copy initialized data from ROM to RAM
        - A Default_Handler() function, which does nothing and is assigned to unimplemented interrupts
        - A reference to __StackTop, defined in the linker script and used as the first entry in the vector table

    NOTE:
        - The __StackTop address and the first 15 entries in the vector table are defined by the ARM Cortex-M architecture
        - The remaining interrupt vector entries are vendor-specific (defined by STMicroelectronics in this case)
