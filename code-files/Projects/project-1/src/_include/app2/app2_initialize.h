=   General Description                                                                                      =

PURPOSE
    -   calll by the `startup_app1` function. Initializes the registers specific for App2. 
        The generic register initialization is handled by the function `Reset_Handler(void)` in `startup.c`, 
        which also calls `main()`.

        This method is typically called from a derived member object of base_app_factory.
