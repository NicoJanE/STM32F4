  PURPOSE
  - General project specific defintions
  - Standard C library includes that are used often.
      - Note for standard includes that are not used so often:    
          - Include those in the .c file OR
          - When used more often, but not so often, create a specialized  general-domain-name.h file instead of
            using this file.
