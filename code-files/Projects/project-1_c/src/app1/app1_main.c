		toggles LEDs on GPIOD Pins 12, 13, 14, 15 compatible STM32F4 Discovery board
   		reference document: RM0090

		In this template code, we will only turn on some LEDs which require at least
		RCC and GPIO registers.
		RCC is used to turn on the clock to the GPIOD module
		GPIOD is used to drive the LED pins  */

	// Each module is powered separately. In order to turn on a module
	// we need to enable the relevant clock.
	// Set Bit 3 to enable GPIOD clock in AHB1ENR
	// AHB1ENR: XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 1XXX
	RCC->AHB1ENR |= 0x00000008;

	// Another way to write a 1 to a bit location is to shift it that much
	// Meaning shift number 1, 3 times to the left. Which would result in
	// 0b1000 or 0x8
	// RCC->AHB1ENR |= (1 << 3);

	// In order to make a pin output, we need to write 01 to the relevant
	// section in MODER register
	// We first need to AND it to reset them, then OR it to set them.
