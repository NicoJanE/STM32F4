    PURPOSE
    - General project-specific definitions
    - Standard C library includes that are used often.
        - Note for standard includes that are not used so often:    
            - Include those in the .c file OR
            - When used more often, but not so often, create a specialized general-domain-name.h file instead of
              using this file.

  LINK GUARDS
  - We use linkage guards in a single `general.h` include file to ensure proper C linkage when called from C++.
    This allows functions and headers to be compatible with both C and C++ codebases.

    ALTERNATIVE APPROACH:
    1. In larger projects or when there is a clear separation between C and C++ components, consider splitting this
       header into two separate headers:
       - `general_c.h` for C-specific includes
       - `general_cpp.h` for C++-specific includes
       This approach is useful when:
       - The headers required for C and C++ diverge significantly.
       - You want to keep the headers lightweight and modular.

    2. You could use the special `<cstring>` headers (not by default included in the include path) to use functions
       with C linkage in C++. However, this does NOT work in our case because there are a lot of dependencies.

    ðŸ“Œ For this project, we use a single `general.h` file for simplicity and ease of maintenance.
