# STM32 <span style="color: #409EFF; font-size: 0.6em; font-style: italic;"> -  Docker bare-metal C/C++ project Container</span>

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Introduction

A minimal yet flexible bare-metal C/C++ project for STM32F4-Discovery and related STM32F4 devices.

### ‚ú® Features

- Built using make (no IDE dependency, Visual Studio Code supported)
- C Project (`./projects/project-1_c`)
  - Polymorphic design in C to support multiple independent applications  (`app1`, `app2`)
  - Each app can be configured separately to perform its task
  - Demonstrates:
    - USART communication (tested with PuTTY)
    - Blinking LEDs
    - ntegration of the standard C runtime (e.g., `malloc`, `printf`, `scanf`) through custom system call implementations
- C++ Project ( ***./projects/project-1_cpp***)
  - Same basic functionality as the C project. Startup code in C; rest in C++
  - Improved Makefile
  - Utility to display include dependencies

### üêû Flashing & Debugging (manual and with VSC)

- Uses `st-flash` (from [stlink](https://github.com/stlink-org/stlink)) to program the STM32F4-Discovery
- Can be debugged with `gdb-multiarch` via OpenOCD
- Easily integrated with Visual Studio Code or CLI workflows for breakpoint debugging and memory inspection
  - `launch.json` to flash and debug the program
  - `tasks.json` to build and run commands inside the containers

## ‚ö°Getting Started

This project serves as a clean, extensible foundation for low-level STM32 development, showcasing both embedded and software design principles.You can use this container to start programming and experimenting in your local Debian environment.
